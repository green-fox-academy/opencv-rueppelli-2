      - userCmdAfterSet ( the SQL code after 'SET' command )
  - return type:
      - int ( 0 if the record is modified succesfully, 1 if any type of error occured )
  - purpose:
      - with the help of this function you can modify values in your table
      
### selectRecords

```int selectRecords(std::string databasePath, std::string tableName, std::string chooseRecord)```

  - parameters:

  - return type:
      - int ( 0 if the record is chosen successfully, 1 if any type of error occured )
  - purpose:
      - with the help of this function you can select records from the given table
      
      
### detectCircles

```int detectCircle(cv::Mat img)```

   - parameters:
      - img ( the picture you want to use )
   - return type:
      - int ( numbers of circles detected )
   - purpose:
      - this function detects the number of circles in the picture
      
### bluringImage

```void bluring_image()```

   - purpose:
      - this function can create trackbars
      
     
### selectionSort

```std::vector<int> selectionSort(std::vector<int> myVector, int &counter, int order)```

```int* selectionSort(int myArray[], int sizeOfArray, int &counter, int order)```

   - parameters: 
      - myVector/myArray ( the vector/array you want to sort )
      - sizeOfArray ( only if it's an array )
      - &counter ( counts the steps ) 
      - order ( if the value is 0 it prints out the numbers in descending order, if 1 it prints out the numbers in increasing order, ((default value = 1)) )
   - return type:
      - std::vector<int>/int* ( returns the sorted vector/array )
   - purpose:
      - the aim of this function is to sort the numbers of the vector/array in descending or increasing order
   
### insertionSort

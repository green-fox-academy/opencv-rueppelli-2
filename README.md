# opencv-rueppelli-2

# This is a software being developed by students of GFA in the project phase. 

# It is written in C++ and uses the openCV library for picture processing. 
# It can detect circles on any given picture. 
# We can modify the picture with gaussian or median blur for more accurate detection. 
# The number of circles detected on a picture and the time in which it was processed are saved into an SQLite database.
# We unit test the software with googletest.

#Our aim is to increase accuracy of image detection and to add useful features during the development.
